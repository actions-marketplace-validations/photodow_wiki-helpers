`UI Component`

This [[CTA]] (call to action) component allows one to quickly switch between a couple different [[CTA]] easily based on a given scenario. This makes it easy to offer them all without building that logic every-time, or just as easily limit the number of options for a specific pattern.

### 1. Type

#### 1.1 Jump
The jump link visually uses the down arrow to indicate to the user this link jumps down the page.

The default text style is just a textual link with an icon. This type of [[CTA]] can be used at low levels within the page hierarchy.

| 2.1 | `style === 'text'` | Set the data model and component to leverage: [[Link with icon]] |
